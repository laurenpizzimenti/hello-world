Refresher on GitHub &amp; Coding!
Looking to get back into Github, in a personal exploratory area, to learn more beyond just file storage. Excited to expand skills in python and store code here to build a portfoilio and stronger working knowledge of Git capabilities for professional and personal use. 

Note: professional and private data work will still only be on the corporate Git account of mine, this will be more for learning and outside projects.
